# NLP-TensorFlow

This Jupyter notebook uses movie reviews for classifying the text between positive and negative sentiment. The project follows the Text Classification tutorial here: https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/tf2_text_classification. A TensorFlow model embedding sentences with a Keras layer were used in this project. Kaggle was used to train the model as their GPU accelerator makes running the notebook faster.
